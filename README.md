# FYP Proposal Management System

## Description
This GitHub project proposes a user-friendly and efficient management system tailored for Antonine University's Final Year Project (FYP) process. The web application offers features to streamline FYP proposals, including a regularly updated advisors directory with real-time availability, a central communication platform for students and supervisors, and a recommendation function to match students with suitable advisors based on interests and project needs. By addressing challenges faced by fifth-year engineering students, this system aims to enhance the FYP experience at Antonine University.
